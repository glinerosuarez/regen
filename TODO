1. Implement mypy and pyre https://pyre-check.org/docs/getting-started for statical type check
2. increase observation features
3. Encapsulate all repository logic(remote and db) inside Repository class.
4. when collecting data we get n + 1 observations stored in the db instead of n
5. We need to segment observations by episode because observations won't be stored continuously but in a sparse fashion
